#How does EVA work? ![ü§î](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t34/1/16/1f914.png)

Eva- was created to help in the Management and Supervision of Students of the Angolan Community located in Russia, specifically in the city of Voronezh, and it gives the possibility to list all Students based on Country, University, Faculty, Dormitory, Room and etc.

How long was it developed? ![‚è≥](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tb7/1/16/23f3.png)![üò±](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t2c/1/16/1f631.png)

EVA was developed over a period of 3 months, starting in March 2021..

To concrete what does EVA do? ? ![ü•∫](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t9b/1/16/1f97a.png)![üôáüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t3e/1/16/1f647_1f3fd_200d_2642.png)

EVA was developed with the intention of helping departments of companies or universities that are very far apart, thus facilitating the sharing of student or employee data between those departments with record speed in data synchronization

We have the UAN university in Angola ! ![üá¶üá¥](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tc5/1/16/1f1e6_1f1f4.png), which is the headquarters of the university, and another department around the Martyrs or International Airport, this way if a university employee requests the data of a student who was transferred from the University Campus to these departments, through a click or by typing the name of the student, all the data linked to the student will be shown. And if on Campus another employee edits the student's data, in seconds these changes will be shown to the department located in M√°rtires.
